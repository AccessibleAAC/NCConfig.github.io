        <p>
        This help documentation assumes that the user has a netClé hub, 
        appropriate peripherals and cables and that the user understands how to connect them.  
        (Descriptions of the netClé hub hardware and peripheral can be found <a href="index.html"> here</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
        The netClé configuration tool is a web-based application that uses the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API"> web serial API</a> 
        not supported by all browsers at this time (e.g. Firefox, Safari).  
        </p>
        <p>
        Supported browsers are Chrome (this includes Chromium), Edge and Opera.  
        To enable the web serial API it may be necessary to navigate to one of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</li>
            <li>edge://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</li>
            <li>opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        and set the option to 'enabled'.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="section1" class="helpcontent">
        <p>
        To create a new configuration for your netClé open your browser 
        (see introduction for browser requirements) and navigate to 
        to the netClé Configuration Tool.
        </p><p>
        To create a new configuration click on the “Add Solution” button.   
        You will be asked to select a computer function.  After you select the function, 
        you will be asked which device you wish to use for that function 
        (typically one or two buttons or a joystick).  
        Select a device which is appropriate for the user's ability.
        Finally you will be offered a 
        list of available pre-built solutions.  If you hover the cursor over 
        a solution you will see a brief description on the right.
        </p>
        <img class="img" src="images/NewSolution.png" alt="Image: Create a solution">
        <p>
        After you select a solution you will be presented with a screen 
        which provides a more detailed description and allows you to make 
        adjustments to the configuration.  You can select the port to which 
        you will connect the peripheral and for most solutions you are given 
        the option to use a wired connection USB or a Bluetooth connection.  
        (Note: To use the Bluetooth option you will need a Bluetooth-enabled
        hub.)
        </p>
        <p>
        You may add several solutions.  Typically users want a method of 
        controlling the mouse and a method for generating mouse clicks or 
        perhaps some special keyboard actions.  Each solution you add will 
        create a new tab.  You can remove a solution by clicking on the 
        small x on the right side of the tab.
        </p>
        <img class="img" src="images/Solutions.png" alt="Image: Solutions">
        <p>
        Once you have completed your selection click on the ‘Set’ button.  
        You will be asked to connect your netClé hub to your computer’s USB 
        port.  Once the connection is complete you should get a confirmation 
        that the download is complete.  In addition the netClé will emit two 
        high beeps to indicate that it received the data correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
        Try out your new configuration.  If you want to adjust something or 
        try a different solution you can make the configuration changes and 
        then press ‘Set’ to download the adjusted configuration to the hub.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="section2" class="helpcontent">
        <p>
        If, after using your device for a while, you want to make some 
        adjustment to the configuration, open the configuration tool 
        and click on ‘Get’.  You will be prompted to 
        connect your hub to your computer and when the connection is 
        complete you should see your netClé configuration  displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
        At this point you can make adjustments (or even create a whole new 
        configuration) and then press ‘Set’ to send that configuration to the hub.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is easy to try out different configurations and options in order 
        to see what works best for you.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>In summary:</i>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
        'Set' sends the configuration you have on your screen to the hub and overwrites everything that used to be there.
            </li><li>
        'Get' gets the configuration from the hub and displays it – overwriting everything that used to be on your screen.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="section3" class="helpcontent">
        <p>
        If you have an existing configuration that was created using an earlier
        configuration tool you should begin by connecting your 
        device and pressing ‘Get’.  This will load your existing 
        configuration into the configuration tool.
        </p>
        <p>
        The configuration tool can recognize any solution that it created, 
        and will recognize some custom solutions built by other tools, 
        but in many cases it will not recognize old solutions.  When this 
        is the case those solutions will be presented in a tab 
        labeled “Unknown”.  
        </p>
        <img class="img" src="images/Unknown.png" alt="Image: Unknown Solution">
        <p>
        You may add new solutions to unused ports.  When you click on 
        ‘Set’ the old configurations will be preserved.  You may also choose 
        to delete one or more ‘Unknown’ tabs (by clicking on the ‘x’ on the 
        right edge of the tab) and replace them with a one of the 
        pre-defined solutions.   In many cases there will be a solution 
        available in the new tool which is functionally equivalent to your 
        old configuration.  The old configuration is unrecognized only 
        because it is slightly different in some detail.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="section4" class="helpcontent">
        <p>
        When you use a solution which involves moving the cursor, the speed 
        the cursor moves can be adjusted.  Clicking on the ‘Cursor Speed’ 
        button brings up a window that lets you adjust the speed.  
        Typically it is good to have the cursor start slowly and then speed up.  
        </p>
        <p>
        When you click on ‘Set’ the cursor speed settings are sent to the 
        hub along with the rest of the configuration.  Clicking on ‘Get’ 
        retrieves the cursor settings from the hub.
        </p>
        <img class="img" src="images/CursorSpeed.png" alt="Image: Cursor Speed">
    </div>

    <div id="section5" class="helpcontent">
        <p>
        You may want to save your configuration so that you can restore it
        after some experimentation.  Or, you may want to load a configuration
        sent to you by technical support or even share a configuration
        with other netClé users..  The <i>Copy</i> and <i>Paste</i> 
        buttons and the area labeled <i>Drop Zone</i> make these actions
        possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        To save a configuration click on the <i>Copy</i> button.  You will
        see a message telling you that the configuration data has been
        copied to the clipboard.  Now, open a text file or an e-mail and
        paste the clipboard contents into it (press control-V will do this).
        The pasted text is not very intelligible to a human, but it 
        contains all the configuration details needed by netClé.  Do not 
        attempt to edit this text in any way.  This will make it 
        unreadable to netClé.
        </p>
        <p>
        To restore a configuration you can do the opposite.  In the document
        where the configuration was saved, highlight the configuration text
        and copy the text to the clipboard (control-C will do this).  Then
        click on the <i>Paste</i> button.  The configuration should be
        restored.  This will restore (and replace) both the displayed configuration 
        and the configuration on the hub. 
        Don't worry if you highlight some additional text before or after
        the netClé configuration data.  The loading operation will find 
        the configuration data and ignore the rest of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have a plain-text file (such as a notepad or wordpad file 
        with a .txt extension) which contains a netClé configuration you can
        load that configuration simply by dragging the file and dropping
        it on the area labeled <i>Drop Zone</i>.  This is considerably
        more convenient than opening the document, selecting text and then 
        cutting and pasting.  You can also drag and drop a block of text.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="section6" class="helpcontent">
        <p>
        Clicking on the ‘Levels’ button opens a window that lets you see 
        what the signals levels for each input are.  If you have a gyroscope 
        peripheral attached it will show you how that device reacts to motion.
        </p><p>
        This screen is useful if you suspect that one of you peripherals 
        is malfunctioning or poorly connected.  
        </p><p>
        This screen has no value beyond this trouble shooting activity.
