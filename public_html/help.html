            <h2>General Comments</h2>
            <p>
            The following documentation assumes that the user has a netClé hub, 
            appropriate peripherals and cables and understands how to connect them.  
            Details of this are not covered in this document.
            </p>
            <p>
            The configuration tool is a web-based application.  
            The functions that allow the web application to communicate are not 
            supported by all browsers.  In addition, you must enable experimental 
            features so that your web browser can communicate with your netClé.
            </p>
            <p>
            Supported browsers are Chrome (this includes Chromium), Edge and Opera.  
            To enable the experimental features navigate to one of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</li>
                <li>edge://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</li>
                <li>opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            and set the option to 'enabled'.
            </p>
            <h2>New to netClé?</h2>
            <p>
            To create a new configuration for your netClé open your browser 
            (see above for browser requirements) and navigate to ncconfig.github.io.  
            This will bring you to the netClé Configuration Tool.
            </p><p>
            To create a new configuration click on the “Add Solution” button.   
            You will be asked to select a computer function.  After you select that 
            you will be asked which device you wish to use for that function 
            (typically one or two buttons or a joystick).  
            Select a device which is appropriate for the user's ability.
            Finally you will be offered a 
            list of available pre-built solutions.  If you hover the cursor over 
            a solution you will see a brief description on the right.
            </p>
            <img class="img" src="NewSolution.png" alt="Image: Create a solution">
            <p>
            After you select a solution you will be presented with a screen 
            which provides a more detailed description and allows you to make 
            adjustments to the configuration.  You can select the port to which 
            you will connect the peripheral and for most solutions you are given 
            the option to use a wired connection or a Bluetooth connection.  
            (Note: To use the Bluetooth option you will need a Bluetooth-enabled
            hub.)
            </p>
            <p>
            You may add several solutions.  Typically users want a method of 
            controlling the mouse and a method for generating mouse clicks or 
            perhaps some special keyboard actions.  Each solution you add will 
            create a new tab.  You can remove a solution by clicking on the 
            small x on the right side of the tab.
            </p>
            <img class="img" src="Solutions.png" alt="Image: Solutions">
            <p>
            Once you have completed your selection click on the ‘Set’ button.  
            You will be asked to connect your netClé hub to your computer’s USB 
            port.  Once the connection is complete you should get a confirmation 
            that the download is complete.  In addition the netClé will emit two 
            high beeps to indicate that it received the data correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
            Try out your new configuration.  If you want to adjust something or 
            try a different solution you can make the configuration changes and 
            then press ‘Set’ to download the adjusted configuration to the hub.
            </p>
            <h2> Want to adjust your configuration?</h2>
            <p>
            If, after using your device for a while, you want to make some 
            adjustment to the configuration, open the configuration tool 
            (<a href="ncconfig.github.io">ncconfig.github.io</a>) and click on ‘Get’.  You will be prompted to 
            connect your hub to your computer and when the connection is 
            complete you should see the configuration you previously downloaded.
            </p>
            <p>
            At this point you can make adjustments (or even create a whole new 
            configuration) and then press ‘Set’ to send that configuration to the hub.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is easy to try out different configurations and options in order 
            to see which is best for you.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>In summary:</i>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
            'Set' sends the configuration you have on your screen to the hub and overwrites everything that used to be there.
                </li><li>
            'Get' gets the configuration from the hub and displays it – overwriting everything that used to be on your screen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>If you have an existing netClé configuration</h2>
            <p>
            If you have an existing configuration that was created using an earlier
            configuration tool you should begin by connecting your 
            device and pressing ‘Get’.  This will load your existing 
            configuration into the configuration tool.
            </p>
            <p>
            The configuration tool can recognize any solution that it created, 
            and will recognize some custom solutions built by other tools, 
            but in many cases it will not recognize old solutions.  When this 
            is the case those solutions will be presented in a tab 
            labeled “Unknown”.  
            </p>
            <img class="img" src="Unknown.png" alt="Image: Unknown Solution">
            <p>
            You may add new solutions to unused ports.  When you click on 
            ‘Set’ the old configurations will be preserved.  You may also choose 
            to delete one or more ‘Unknown’ tabs (by clicking on the ‘x’ on the 
            right edge of the tab) and replace them with a one of the 
            pre-defined solutions.   In many cases there will be a solution 
            available in the new tool which is functionally equivalent to your 
            old configuration.  The old configuration is unrecognized only 
            because it is slightly different in some detail.
            </p>
            <h2>Cursor Speed</h2>
            <p>
            When you use a solution which involves moving the cursor, the speed 
            the cursor moves can be adjusted.  Clicking on the ‘Cursor Speed’ 
            button brings up a window that lets you adjust the speed.  
            Typically it is good to have the cursor start slowly and then speed up.  
            </p><p>
            When you click on ‘Set’ the cursor speed settings are sent to the 
            hub along with the rest of the configuration.  Clicking on ‘Get’ 
            retrieves the cursor settings from the hub.
            </p>

            <h2>Import and Export</h2>
            <p>
            You may want to save your configuration so that you can restore it
            after some experimentation.  Or, you may want to load a configuration
            sent to you by technical support or even share a configuration
            with other netClé users..  The <i>Copy</i> and <i>Paste</i> 
            buttons and the area labeled <i>Drop Zone</i> make these actions
            possible.
            </p>
            <p>
            To save a configuration click on the <i>Copy</i> button.  You will
            see a message telling you that the configuration data has been
            copied to the clipboard.  Now, open a text file or an e-mail and
            paste the clipboard contents into it (press control-V will do this).
            The pasted text is not very intelligible to a human, but it 
            contains all the configuration details needed by netClé.  Do not 
            attempt to edit this text in any way.  This will make it 
            unreadable to netClé.
            </p>
            <p>
            To restore a configuration you can do the opposite.  In the document
            where the configuration was saved, highlight the configuration text
            and copy the text to the clipboard (control-C will do this).  Then
            click on the <i>Paste</i> button.  The configuration should be
            restored.  This will restore (and replace) both the displayed configuration 
            and the configuration on the hub. 
            Don't worry if you highlight some additional text before or after
            the netClé configuration data.  The loading operation will find 
            the configuration data and ignore the rest of the text.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you have a plain-text file (such as a notepad or wordpad file 
            with a .txt extension) which contains a netClé configuration you can
            load that configuration simply by dragging the file and dropping
            it on the area labeled <i>Drop Zone</i>.  This is considerably
            more convenient than opening the document, selecting text and then 
            cutting and pasting.  You can also drag and drop a block of text.
            </p>
            <h2>Levels</h2>
            <p>
            Clicking on the ‘Levels’ button opens a window that lets you see 
            what the signals levels for each input are.  If you have a gyroscope 
            peripheral attached it will show you how that device reacts to motion.
            </p><p>
            This screen is useful if you suspect that one of you peripherals 
            is malfunctioning or poorly connected.  
            </p><p>
            This screen has no value beyond this trouble shooting activity.
